I am a motivated and skilled backend developer with a strong foundation in tech. Currently, I am working at Tekion, where I specialize in the Spring Boot framework. With a fair understanding of frontend development and proficiency in React, I bring a holistic perspective to my projects. I have hands-on experience with various tools and technologies, including Git, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, Rancher, and database technologies like PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MongoDB. Additionally, I have foundational knowledge in other stacks such as LAMP (PHP), MERN, and Django full stack.
